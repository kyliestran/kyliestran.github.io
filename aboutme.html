    <h3> About me </h3>
    <p> I am a Marketing Major with a Creative Technology and Design minor, graduating in May 2022 from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am from Huntington Beach, CA and have two older sisters and the cutest nephew on Earth! I am currently a TA for the Business School and an Intern for a retained search and advisory company based out of North Carolina. I am apart of Kappa Alpha Theta and was the KATWalk Chair in 2018, raising over $25,000 for Boulder CASA. My favorite shows are Vanderpump Rules, Schitt's Creek, Shameless, and American Ninja Warrior. I enjoy spending my time on TikTok as well as going for walks around Boulder with my friends. </p>
