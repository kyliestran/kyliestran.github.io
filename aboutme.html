    <p> I want to be able to make something cool that I can show my parents to prove that I am learning something in college! </p>
    <h3> About me! </h3>
    <p> I am a Marketing Major with a CTE minor, graduating in May 2022. I am from Huntington Beach, CA and have two older sisters and the cutest nephew on Earth! I am currently a TA for the Business School and an Intern for a retained search and advisory company based out of North Carolina. My favorite shows are Vanderpump Rules and Schitt's Creek. I enjoy spending my time on Tik Tok as well as going for walks around Boulder. </p>
